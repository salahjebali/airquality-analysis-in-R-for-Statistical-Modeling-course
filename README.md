# airquality-analysis-in-R-for-Statistical-Modeling-course-
This is the final project for the Statistical Modeling exam of my master of engineering degree in Artificial Intelligence at University of Florence - 2021/2022.

It consists in the analysis of the airquality of New York in R, using the main statistical models. 

You can find the R codes and the final report in italian 57 pages long, completed with codes, comments, graphs and more. English report soon available... 

# Introduction to the problem 

Among the variables contained in the dataset, the one that influences air quality is the concentration of molecules
of Ozone contained in the atmosphere. 
Ozone is a gas with a high oxidizing power, with a blue color and with a pungent odor. Ozone is a very toxic pollutant for humans and, 
in addition to being an irritant for all mucous membranes, a critical and prolonged exposure can cause coughing, headaches and even
pulmonary edema. 
In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO), in order to reduce the danger of acute and chronic damage and to ensure an additional margin of safety, 
recommends as a limit level of exposure, beyond which there is a risk to human health, 120 Î¼g /m3.

In this project i've tried to find a model that could predict the levels of Ozone in the air, given the others explanatory variables: 
intensity of solar radiation, wind speed and temperature of the atmosphere.
